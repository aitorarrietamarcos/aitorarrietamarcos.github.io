# About Me

I am a lecturer and researcher at the University of Mondragon. My research interests include software engineering and software testing areas, mostly related to the application of these techniques in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems. In the last years, my research has centered on the test oracle problem for this context.

My research is industry-oriented. I collaborate with different industrial companies to better understand which their real problems are.

I am currently involved in the coordination of the [Adeptness project](https://www.adeptness.eu/), although I actively participate in the technical part. Specifically, I am working on automated approaches for the multi-level testing of Cyber-Physical Systems.

## Lecturing

* Since 2018 to now, I have been the lecturer of "Industrial Informatics" (4.5 ECTS), at bachelor degree level.
* I also teach yearly a seminar on "Methodological guidelines for the preparation of a doctoral dissertation", at doctoral level.
* At master level, I taughted the course "Verification and Validation of Embedded Systems" (6 ECTS), in 2018 and 2019 
* I also taughted other subjects (e.g., Basic Programming) at different engineering degrees (Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, etc.)

## Students Supervision
