# About Me

I am a lecturer and researcher at the University of Mondragon. My research interests include software engineering and software testing areas, mostly related to the application of these techniques in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems. In the last few years, my research has centered on the test oracle problem for this context and test optimization techniques.

My research is industry-oriented. I collaborate with different industrial companies to better understand which their real problems are.

I am currently involved in the coordination of the [Adeptness project](https://www.adeptness.eu/), although I actively participate in the technical part. Specifically, I am working on automated approaches for the multi-level testing of Cyber-Physical Systems.
