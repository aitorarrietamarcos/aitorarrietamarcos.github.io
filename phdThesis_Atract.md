# PhD on Automated Program Repair of Cyber-Physical Systems

The Spanish Research Council has just funded our project ATRACT, which aims to investigate novel techniques to automatically repair bugs of Cyber-Physical Systems. We will leverage techniques based on Large Language Models and Search-based Algorithms that will aim to automatically repair software bugs related to CPSs. The project includes salary for 4 years and significant funding to attend international conferences!
